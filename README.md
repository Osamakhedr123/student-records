# Student Records  
This C++ program asks the user to enter the records for a number of student in a number of subjects. These numbers are specified by the user.
The program then:
- calculates the average score per student.
- prints the details of the students {First name, Last name, ID} who got the highest and lowest accumulative scores in all subjects.
- Prints the number of succeeded students per subject (assuming the success score is greater than or equal 50).
- Prints the standard deviation (SD) per subject.
- Store all input and output to a text file in the same directory.
